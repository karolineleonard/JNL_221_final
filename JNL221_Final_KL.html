				Violent crime data from the FBI revealed a 37.7% decrease in violent crime rates in the U.S.  since 1979. That year, the U.S. saw a rate of 548.9 violent crimes per 100,000 people whereas, in 2020, there were 398.5 violent crimes per 100,000 people. 
			</p>
			<p id="story_p">
				As <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/violent-crime">defined</a> by the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting, violent crimes are offenses that involve either the use of force or the threat of force. In the data set provided by the FBI, the crimes included are homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, property crimes, burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft.
			</p>
			<p id="story_p">
				 The data set covers all 50 states and the District of Columbia from 1979 to the most recent available data in 2020.
			</p>
			<p id="story_p">
				The decline reigned true even just in the last decade. 
			</p>
			<h3>Violent crime rates over past 10 years</h3>
			<p id="story_p">
				Since 2010, violent crimes rates in the U.S. have declined by 1.5%. The U.S. saw a rate of 404.5 violent crimes per 100,000 people in 2010, whereas in 2020, the U.S. experienced 398.5 violent crimes per 100,000 people. 
			</p>
			<p id="story_p">
				For specific crimes, however, the U.S. saw an increase in homicides, aggravated assaults and motor vehicle theft. 
			</p>
			<p id="story_p">
				For homicides, the U.S. saw a 37.6% increase in the last ten years, jumping from a rate of 4.8 homicides per 100,000 people to 6.6 homicides per 100,000 people. Aggravated assaults increased by 10.7% over the same period. In 2010, the U.S. had a rate of 252.8 aggravated assaults per 100,000 people whereas in 2020, the U.S. saw a rate of 279.7 aggravated assaults per 100,000 people. Motor vehicle thefts only increased by 2.9%, jumping from 239.1 thefts per 100,000 people in 2010 to 246.0 thefts per 100,000 people in 2020. 
			</p>
			<p id="story_p">
				Robberies, larcenies and burglaries decreased since 2010. In 2010, the U.S. had a rate of 119.3 robberies per 100,000 people. This decreased by 38%, and in 2020, the U.S. had a rate of 73.9 robberies per 100,000 people.

			<h3>How a change in definition led to more reports of rape</h3>
			<p id="story_p">
				In 2012, the U.S. FBI and then-Attorney General, Eric Holder, announced a new definition of rape to be implemented in 2013. Since then, more accurate reports of rape have emerged with the new definition, allowing for more justice to be served for survivors. 
			</p>
			<p id="story_p">
				The legacy <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/updated-definition-rape">definition</a>, made in 1927, established rape as “the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will.” This legacy definition excluded the rape of males or other genders, the rape of females by females, rape with any object or body part and other rape that doesn’t include the penetration of only the vagina by a penis. 
			</p>
			<p id="story_p">
				The revised definition established rape as “the penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim,” according to the U.S. Department of Justice. 
			</p>
			<p id="story_p">
				Between 2010-12 before the official implementation of the revised definition of rape, the United States averaged 169, 939 rapes per 100,000 people. In 2013 with the new definition, the United States had 227, 390 rapes per 100,000 people that year alone.

				Jackie Johnson, a nurse practicioner and advocat at Planned Parenthood, said the change in definition did not change much in a legal sense, especially for Oklahoma, where she works. 
			</p>
			<p id="story_p">
				"The new definition, while necessary, held little legal repercussions," Johnson said. "Instead, it led to more reports constituting rape over sexual assault or other forms of sexual violence, therefore, unveiling the pure astounding amount of rapes our country sees every year."
			</p>
			<h3>People fear burglaries and break-ins more than  other  crimes</h3>
			<p id="story_p">
				The book, “Understanding and Preventing Violence, Volume 4: Consequences and Control,” <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/4422/chapter/2#8">analyzed</a> how specific people fear specific victimizations of specific offenses. 
			</p>
			<p id="story_p">
				According to the book, investigators assumed fear as associated with specific crimes followed the “severity” of the crime, therefore, people are more afraid of being murdered than of having their car stolen. This is not the case. 
			</p>
			<p id="story_p">
				According to a Warr and Stafford study in 1983 which polled Seattle residents about what specific crimes they feared the most, the severity of the crime did not drive fear in people. Neither did the possibility of promise of bodily harm. 
			</p>
			<p id="story_p">
				The study explained that residents most feared property crimes, more specifically burglary, more than crimes like murder or assault since one’s house being broken into is more likely than somebody being murdered.

				Property crime rates were higher than violent crime rates in the U.S. In 2020, the country saw 103,033.2 property crimes per 100,000 people and 20,599.9 violent crimes per 100,000 people. 
			</p>
			<p id="story_p">
				Over the last ten years, larcenies and burglaries occured starkingly more often than other violent crimes. The U.S. had 9,212,648 larcenies and 2,070,628 burglaries in 2020. By contrast, there was 43,140 homicides and 252,860 rapes that same year. 
			</p>
			<p id="story_p">
				Larcenies, or the unlawful taking of one’s property, was the most common of the provided crimes to occur over the past 10 years, however, people by comparison have a larger fear of burglary since it involves the entering of somebody’s home or building with the intent to steal or commit other crimes. This added layer leads to more fear from people. 
			</p>
			<p id="story_p">
				Since 2010, burglaries in the U.S. have dropped by over 52%. In 2010, there were 34,713.8 burglaries per 100,000 people whereas in 2020, there were 16,392.8 burglaries. Even with this drop, people continue to be afraid of burglaries over other crimes that have increased over the last 10 years, like aggravated assault and motor vehicle theft.
